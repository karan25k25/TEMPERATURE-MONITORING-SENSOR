##A temperature monitoring sensor is any device that measures thermal conditions in its environment and communicates the reading—either through

voltage, resistance, or digital output—for logging, control, or display. These sensors power the data you see on an LCD, transmit over Bluetooth, 

or use within automated control systems.
